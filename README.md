## About Ziti TV

Ziti TV has been going strong since March of 2022! Ziti TV is a recurring series of videos
almost always streamed on Friday's live at 11 AM ET on YouTube. It was formerly also streamed
via Twitter/X until that feature was removed.

On Ziti TV you'll see videos on OpenZiti itself, on new features upcoming, on old features
long-implemented and of course, on zero trust in general. There are also videos realted to the 
OpenZiti subproject BrowZer as well as the popular `zrok` project and Ziti TV loves to feature
the community of users with "User Spotlight" videos where we learn how people have put OpenZiti
into practice.

If you haven't found and subscribed to the OpenZiti YouTube channel you should! The channel
has numerous videos and live streams going back many years and covers all OpenZiti-related tech.

Hopefully we'll see you live on some Friday!
